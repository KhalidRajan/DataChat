The potential risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from the results predicted \\ninclude, among others, those risks and uncertainties included under the captions “Risk Factors” and “Management’s \\nDiscussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for \\nthe year ended December 31, 2023 and our most recent Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June \\n30, 2024, which are on file with the SEC and are available on our investor relations website at http://abc.xyz/investor \\nand on the SEC website at www.sec.gov. Additional information will also be set forth in our Quarterly Report on \\nForm 10-Q for the quarter ended  September 30, 2024 , and may be set forth in other reports and filings we make \\nwith the SEC. All information provided in this release and in the attachments is as of October 29, 2024 . Undue \\nreliance should not be placed on the forward-looking statements in this press release, which are based on \\ninformation available to us on the date hereof. We undertake no duty to update this information unless required by \\nlaw.\\nAbout Non-GAAP Financial Measures\\nTo supplement our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, \\nwe use the following non-GAAP financial measures: free cash flow; constant currency revenues; and percentage \\nchange in constant currency revenues. The presentation of this financial information is not intended to be \\nconsidered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in \\naccordance with GAAP.\\nWe use these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to \\nevaluate period-to-period comparisons. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful \\nsupplemental information regarding our performance and liquidity by excluding certain items that may not be \\nindicative of our recurring core business operating results, such as our revenues excluding the effect of foreign \\nexchange rate movements and hedging activities, which are recognized at the consolidated level. We believe that \\nboth management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our \\nperformance and when planning, forecasting, and analyzing future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures \\nalso facilitate management’s internal comparisons to our historical performance and liquidity as well as comparisons \\nto our competitors’ operating results. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors both \\nbecause (1) they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and \\noperational decision-making and (2) they are used by our institutional investors and the analyst community to help \\nthem analyze the health of our business.\\nThere are a number of limitations related to the use of non-GAAP financial measures. We compensate for these \\nlimitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from these non-GAAP financial \\nmeasures and evaluating these non-GAAP financial measures together with their relevant financial measures in \\naccordance with GAAP.\\nFor more information on these non-GAAP financial measures, please see the sections captioned “ Reconciliation \\nfrom GAAP Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities to Non-GAAP Free Cash Flow ” and “ Reconciliation from \\nGAAP Revenues to Non-GAAP Constant Currency Revenues and GAAP Percentage Change in Revenues to

We believe that \\nboth management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our \\nperformance and when planning, forecasting, and analyzing future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures \\nalso facilitate management’s internal comparisons to our historical performance and liquidity as well as comparisons \\nto our competitors’ operating results. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors both \\nbecause (1) they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and \\noperational decision-making and (2) they are used by our institutional investors and the analyst community to help \\nthem analyze the health of our business.\\nThere are a number of limitations related to the use of non-GAAP financial measures. We compensate for these \\nlimitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from these non-GAAP financial \\nmeasures and evaluating these non-GAAP financial measures together with their relevant financial measures in \\naccordance with GAAP.\\nFor more information on these non-GAAP financial measures, please see the sections captioned “ Reconciliation \\nfrom GAAP Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities to Non-GAAP Free Cash Flow ” and “ Reconciliation from \\nGAAP Revenues to Non-GAAP Constant Currency Revenues and GAAP Percentage Change in Revenues to Non-\\nGAAP Percentage Change in Constant Currency Revenues” included at the end of this release.\\nContact\\nInvestor relations Media\\ninvestor-relations@abc.xyz press@abc.xyz\\n3', path=None,

Additional information will also be set forth in our Quarterly Report on \\nForm 10-Q for the quarter ended  September 30, 2024 , and may be set forth in other reports and filings we make \\nwith the SEC. All information provided in this release and in the attachments is as of October 29, 2024 . Undue \\nreliance should not be placed on the forward-looking statements in this press release, which are based on \\ninformation available to us on the date hereof. We undertake no duty to update this information unless required by \\nlaw.\\nAbout Non-GAAP Financial Measures\\nTo supplement our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, \\nwe use the following non-GAAP financial measures: free cash flow; constant currency revenues; and percentage \\nchange in constant currency revenues. The presentation of this financial information is not intended to be \\nconsidered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in \\naccordance with GAAP.\\nWe use these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to \\nevaluate period-to-period comparisons. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful \\nsupplemental information regarding our performance and liquidity by excluding certain items that may not be \\nindicative of our recurring core business operating results, such as our revenues excluding the effect of foreign \\nexchange rate movements and hedging activities, which are recognized at the consolidated level. We believe that \\nboth management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our \\nperformance and when planning, forecasting, and analyzing future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures \\nalso facilitate management’s internal comparisons to our historical performance and liquidity as well as comparisons \\nto our competitors’ operating results. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors both \\nbecause (1) they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and \\noperational decision-making and (2) they are used by our institutional investors and the analyst community to help \\nthem analyze the health of our business.\\nThere are a number of limitations related to the use of non-GAAP financial measures. We compensate for these \\nlimitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from these non-GAAP financial \\nmeasures and evaluating these non-GAAP financial measures together with their relevant financial measures in \\naccordance with GAAP.\\nFor more information on these non-GAAP financial measures, please see the sections captioned “ Reconciliation \\nfrom GAAP Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities to Non-GAAP Free Cash Flow ” and “ Reconciliation from \\nGAAP Revenues to Non-GAAP Constant Currency Revenues and GAAP Percentage Change in Revenues to Non-\\nGAAP Percentage Change in Constant Currency Revenues” included at the end of this release.\\nContact\\nInvestor relations Media\\ninvestor-relations@abc.xyz press@abc.xyz\\n3', path=None,

We undertake no duty to update this information unless required by \\nlaw.\\nAbout Non-GAAP Financial Measures\\nTo supplement our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, \\nwe use the following non-GAAP financial measures: free cash flow; constant currency revenues; and percentage \\nchange in constant currency revenues. The presentation of this financial information is not intended to be \\nconsidered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in \\naccordance with GAAP.\\nWe use these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to \\nevaluate period-to-period comparisons. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful \\nsupplemental information regarding our performance and liquidity by excluding certain items that may not be \\nindicative of our recurring core business operating results, such as our revenues excluding the effect of foreign \\nexchange rate movements and hedging activities, which are recognized at the consolidated level. We believe that \\nboth management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our \\nperformance and when planning, forecasting, and analyzing future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures \\nalso facilitate management’s internal comparisons to our historical performance and liquidity as well as comparisons \\nto our competitors’ operating results. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors both \\nbecause (1) they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and \\noperational decision-making and (2) they are used by our institutional investors and the analyst community to help \\nthem analyze the health of our business.\\nThere are a number of limitations related to the use of non-GAAP financial measures. We compensate for these \\nlimitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from these non-GAAP financial \\nmeasures and evaluating these non-GAAP financial measures together with their relevant financial measures in \\naccordance with GAAP.\\nFor more information on these non-GAAP financial measures, please see the sections captioned “ Reconciliation \\nfrom GAAP Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities to Non-GAAP Free Cash Flow ” and “ Reconciliation from \\nGAAP Revenues to Non-GAAP Constant Currency Revenues and GAAP Percentage Change in Revenues to

All information provided in this release and in the attachments is as of October 29, 2024 . Undue \\nreliance should not be placed on the forward-looking statements in this press release, which are based on \\ninformation available to us on the date hereof. We undertake no duty to update this information unless required by \\nlaw.\\nAbout Non-GAAP Financial Measures\\nTo supplement our consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, \\nwe use the following non-GAAP financial measures: free cash flow; constant currency revenues; and percentage \\nchange in constant currency revenues. The presentation of this financial information is not intended to be \\nconsidered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, the financial information prepared and presented in \\naccordance with GAAP.\\nWe use these non-GAAP financial measures for financial and operational decision-making and as a means to \\nevaluate period-to-period comparisons. We believe that these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful \\nsupplemental information regarding our performance and liquidity by excluding certain items that may not be \\nindicative of our recurring core business operating results, such as our revenues excluding the effect of foreign \\nexchange rate movements and hedging activities, which are recognized at the consolidated level. We believe that \\nboth management and investors benefit from referring to these non-GAAP financial measures in assessing our \\nperformance and when planning, forecasting, and analyzing future periods. These non-GAAP financial measures \\nalso facilitate management’s internal comparisons to our historical performance and liquidity as well as comparisons \\nto our competitors’ operating results. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures are useful to investors both \\nbecause (1) they allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in its financial and \\noperational decision-making and (2) they are used by our institutional investors and the analyst community to help \\nthem analyze the health of our business.\\nThere are a number of limitations related to the use of non-GAAP financial measures. We compensate for these \\nlimitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from these non-GAAP financial \\nmeasures and evaluating these non-GAAP financial measures together with their relevant financial measures in \\naccordance with GAAP.\\nFor more information on these non-GAAP financial measures, please see the sections captioned “ Reconciliation \\nfrom GAAP Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities to Non-GAAP Free Cash Flow ” and “ Reconciliation from \\nGAAP Revenues to Non-GAAP Constant Currency Revenues and GAAP Percentage Change in Revenues to Non-\\nGAAP Percentage Change in Constant Currency Revenues” included at the end of this release.\\nContact\\nInvestor relations Media\\ninvestor-relations@abc.xyz press@abc.xyz\\n3',
